# Tool-Augmented Real-Time AI Systems: Formalization and End-to-End Design

## Global Formalism for Tool Use in Real-Time AI

- Definition
  A tool-augmented AI system is a partially observable decision process wherein a policy (e.g., an LLM) selects external tool invocations to transform latent state into observations and actions so as to optimize task utility under latency, cost, and safety constraints.

- Mathematical formulation
  Let the interaction be a constrained POMDP:
  $$
  \mathcal{M}=\langle \mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},\mathcal{O},T,O,r,\gamma \rangle
  $$
  where the action space decomposes as $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{A}_{\text{text}}\cup \{(j,\mathbf{a}) : j\in \mathcal{T} \}$ with $\mathcal{T}$ the set of tools and $\mathbf{a}$ the tool arguments.

  Each tool $T_j$ is a stochastic operator with typed signature
  $$
  T_j: \mathcal{X}_j \times \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{Y}_j \times \mathcal{S}, \qquad (y,s')\sim p_j(y,s' \mid x,s),
  $$
  with latency $\tau_j \sim \mathcal{L}_j(\cdot\mid x)$ and monetary cost $c_j(x)$.

  Real-time budgeted objective with deadline $D$ and spend limit $B$:
  $$
  \max_{\pi_\theta} \ \mathbb{E}\big[ U(\text{final output}) \big] \quad
  \text{s.t. } \mathbb{P}(T_{\text{e2e}}\le D)\ge 1-\epsilon,\ \ \mathbb{E}\big[\textstyle\sum c(a_t)\big]\le B
  $$
  using Lagrangian relaxation for optimization:
  $$
  \mathcal{J}(\theta,\lambda,\mu)=\mathbb{E}\left[U-\lambda \sum_t c(a_t)-\mu \max(0,T_{\text{e2e}}-D)\right].
  $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - State $s_t$ summarizes dialogue, retrieved facts, intermediate computations, and UI context.
  - The policy $\pi_\theta(a_t\mid h_t)$ plans tool calls, arguments, and parallelization, and integrates results via an inference-time controller.
  - The controller constructs a computation DAG $G=(V,E)$ over tool nodes with critical-path latency
    $$
    T_{\text{e2e}} = \sum_{v\in \text{CP}(G)} \tau(v),
    $$
    and cost $C_{\text{e2e}}=\sum_{v\in V} c(v)$.

- Importance and role
  Tooling bridges LLM cognition with external sensors, compute, and actuators, enabling grounded reasoning, up-to-date knowledge, numerical reliability, multimodal generation/understanding, and interactive control under strict real-time and budget constraints.

## 1) Function Calling

- Definition
  Function calling exposes deterministic or probabilistic external procedures to the model through typed schemas; the model emits a structured call that is executed by an orchestrator and the results are fed back into context.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Typed schema as a signature:
    $$
    f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}, \quad \mathcal{X} = \prod_k \mathcal{D}_k, \ \ \mathcal{D}_k \text{ typed domains}
    $$
  - The controller emits a call distribution:
    $$
    \pi_\theta(j,\mathbf{a}\mid h) = \sigma(W \phi(h)) \cdot \prod_k q_\theta(a_k\mid h)
    $$
    with a gating variable $g_j\in\{0,1\}$. A budget-regularized loss:
    $$
    \mathcal{L} = -\mathbb{E}[U] + \lambda \, \mathbb{E}\Big[\sum_t c(a_t)\Big].
    $$
  - Credit assignment via REINFORCE when calls are discrete:
    $$
    \nabla_\theta \mathbb{E}[U] \approx \mathbb{E}\left[(U-b)\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(j,\mathbf{a}\mid h)\right].
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Interface: JSON schema for arguments, versioned function identifiers, deterministic or stochastic outputs, and machine-readable error codes.
  - Planning: tool selection as a bandit over candidate functions with context features; composition yields a DAG with type-checked edges.
  - Reliability: argument validation, retries with exponential backoff, idempotency keys, and semantic fallbacks.
  - Safety: allowlist of functions; taint tracking on outputs to prevent prompt-injection propagation.

- Importance and role
  - Deterministic grounding for actions such as database queries, transactions, or service orchestration.
  - Reduces hallucination via executable verification and structured I/O.
  - Enables complex workflows: calling solvers, simulators, or domain APIs within the reasoning loop.

## 2) Web Search

- Definition
  Web search provides real-time retrieval from the Internet, returning ranked snippets and documents for freshness and breadth.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Query reformulation:
    $$
    \tilde{q} = \arg\max_{q' \in \mathcal{Q}} \ \mathbb{E}[U \mid q', h]
    $$
  - Ranking score via a hybrid model:
    $$
    s(d,q) = \alpha \cdot \text{BM25}(d,q) + \beta \cdot \langle e(d), e(q)\rangle + \gamma \cdot r_\psi(d,q),
    $$
    with cross-encoder $r_\psi$ and embeddings $e(\cdot)$.
  - Top-k retrieval with MMR:
    $$
    \text{MMR}(d) = \lambda s(d,q) - (1-\lambda)\max_{d' \in S} \text{sim}(d,d').
    $$
  - Freshness factor:
    $$
    s'(d,q) = s(d,q) + \eta \cdot \text{recency}(d).
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Pipeline: query generation → SERP fetch → snippet/document fetching → deduplication → re-ranking → citation-grounded synthesis.
  - Evidence tracking: store $(d,\text{URL},\text{timestamp})$ and provenance graph to support auditability.
  - Adversarial robustness: prompt-injection filters, source trust estimation, and content sanitization.

- Importance and role
  - Access to up-to-date facts, long-tail knowledge, and emerging events critical for decision-making, monitoring, and situational awareness in real-time systems.

## 3) Remote MCP Servers (Model Context Protocol)

- Definition
  MCP exposes remote capabilities to the model as discoverable, typed tools via a standardized protocol, enabling capability injection from external services at runtime.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Capability discovery adds tools to $\mathcal{T}$:
    $$
    \mathcal{T} \leftarrow \mathcal{T} \cup \{T_j^{\text{MCP}}\}_{j=1}^m, \quad T_j^{\text{MCP}}: \mathcal{X}_j \to \mathcal{Y}_j
    $$
  - Service-level constraints per tool $j$:
    $$
    \mathbb{P}(\tau_j \le d_j) \ge 1-\epsilon_j, \quad \mathbb{E}[c_j] \le b_j
    $$
    with orchestrator enforcing SLO-aware routing.

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Session initialization performs handshake, tool registry sync, schema validation, and auth.
  - Streaming: server-to-model incremental tokens or chunked binary streams treated as partial observations $o_t$ for early reasoning.
  - Versioning and capability negotiation: backward-compatible schema evolution with feature flags.

- Importance and role
  - Scalable capability federation (databases, simulators, enterprise systems) without retraining.
  - Enables modular, multi-tenant architectures and compliance isolation in production.

---

## 4) File Search

- Definition
  File search retrieves and ranks content from local or remote corpora (structured or unstructured) to ground model outputs via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

- Mathematical formulation
  - Embedding index:
    $$
    e_\phi: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R}^d, \quad I=\text{ANNIndex}(\{e_\phi(d_i)\})
    $$
  - Chunking with content-defined boundaries: choose chunk set $C=\{c_i\}$ to minimize boundary loss
    $$
    \min_{C} \sum_i \ell_{\text{overlap}}(c_i) + \ell_{\text{semantic}}(c_i)
    $$
  - Retrieval:
    $$
    S_k(q) = \arg\max_{S:|S|=k} \sum_{d\in S} \langle e_\phi(d), e_\phi(q)\rangle - \lambda \sum_{d\neq d'} \text{sim}(d,d').
    $$
  - Fusion-in-decoder utility:
    $$
    p(y\mid x, S_k) \propto \exp\left( \sum_{d\in S_k} \alpha_d \cdot \log p_\theta(y \mid x, d) \right).
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Multi-stage retrieval: lexical (BM25) + dense ANN + cross-encoder re-ranking.
  - Data governance: ACL-aware retrieval and redaction at chunk-level; provenance tags preserved into the prompt.
  - Index maintenance: freshness via incremental updates and deletion propagation; staleness bounds.

- Importance and role
  - Accurate, citeable grounding on proprietary corpora, essential for compliance, explainability, and low hallucination rates in enterprise and scientific workflows.

## 5) Image Generation and Editing

- Definition
  Image generation and editing use conditional generative models to synthesize or modify images given text and/or image conditions.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM):
    - Forward:
      $$
      q(\mathbf{x}_t\mid \mathbf{x}_0)=\mathcal{N}\big(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\mathbf{x}_0,(1-\bar{\alpha}_t)\mathbf{I}\big)
      $$
    - Reverse learned by $\epsilon_\theta$ with loss:
      $$
      \mathcal{L}_{\text{DDPM}}=\mathbb{E}_{t,\mathbf{x}_0,\epsilon}\left[\lVert \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t, c) \rVert_2^2\right]
      $$
      where $c$ encodes text via cross-attention.
  - Classifier-free guidance:
    $$
    \hat{\epsilon}_\theta = (1+w)\epsilon_\theta(\cdot \mid c) - w \epsilon_\theta(\cdot \mid \varnothing)
    $$
  - Inpainting: mask $M$ with consistency constraint
    $$
    \mathbf{x}_{t+1} = M \odot \mathbf{x}^{\text{pred}}_{t+1} + (1-M)\odot \mathbf{x}^{\text{obs}}.
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Conditioning modalities: text, edges/poses (ControlNet), reference style, region masks.
  - Editing pipeline: detect → segment → generate masked regions with structure-preserving priors.
  - Safety: content filters, watermarking, and provenance (C2PA) for downstream trust.

- Importance and role
  - Multimodal grounding and UI/UX generation, rapid prototyping, simulation data synthesis for vision training, and interactive design loops.

---

## 6) Code Interpreter

- Definition
  A sandboxed execution environment that runs code (e.g., Python) at inference-time to perform precise computation, data analysis, and programmatic I/O.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a language with interpreter $\mathcal{I}$; executing program $z$ on input $x$ yields
    $$
    (y,\log) = \mathcal{I}(z,x), \quad y = f_z(x)
    $$
    with resource constraints $(\text{CPU}, \text{RAM}, \text{wall-clock})$ and cost $c(z,x)$.
  - Planner chooses between symbolic LLM computation and executable code under accuracy-latency tradeoffs:
    $$
    a^\star = \arg\max_{a\in\{\text{LLM},\text{Code}\}} \ \mathbb{E}[U \mid a] - \lambda \, \mathbb{E}[c \mid a].
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Toolchain: library allowlist, network isolation, file I/O quotas, and artifact caching.
  - Program synthesis: LLM proposes $z$, unit-tests on synthetic cases, repair via feedback, then final execution.
  - Numerical reliability: exact arithmetic, deterministic algorithms, and confidence intervals for statistical outputs.

- Importance and role
  - Eliminates arithmetic and algorithmic hallucinations; enables data science, plotting, simulation, and format conversions inside the reasoning loop.

## 7) Computer Use (GUI/Agentic Control)

- Definition
  An agent controls a computer interface (apps, web UIs) via actions like click, type, scroll, drag, and read, to accomplish tasks requiring multi-step interaction with software.

- Mathematical formulation
  - MDP over UI state space using a multimodal perception function $o_t = g(\text{screenshot}_t, \text{DOM}_t)$:
    $$
    s_{t+1}\sim T(s_t,a_t), \quad a_t\in \{\text{click}(x,y),\ \text{type}(w),\ \text{scroll}(\Delta)\ldots\}
    $$
  - Policy factorization with affordance map $A(u)$ over UI elements $u$:
    $$
    \pi_\theta(a_t\mid o_t)=\sum_{u} \pi_\theta(u\mid o_t)\,\pi_\theta(a_t\mid u,o_t).
    $$
  - Goal-conditioned planning with success budget:
    $$
    \max_\pi \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T r_t\right] \ \text{s.t.}\ \sum_t c(a_t)\le B,\ \mathbb{P}(\text{success}\le D)\ge 1-\epsilon.
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Perception: OCR, element detection, DOM parsing, and grounding natural-language targets to UI affordances.
  - Skills: macro-operators (login, upload, search) learned via imitation, composed via options in hierarchical RL.
  - Robustness: visual changes handled by representation learning; recovery policies for unexpected modals.

- Importance and role
  - Automates end-to-end workflows involving legacy or third-party UIs, enabling integration when APIs are unavailable and supporting human-in-the-loop operations.

## Cross-Cutting Mechanisms for Real-Time Capability

### A) Tool Selection and Composition

- Definition
  The policy that chooses which tools to invoke, in what order/parallelism, with arguments and stopping conditions.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Tool value-of-information (VoI):
    $$
    \text{VoI}(T_j\mid h)=\mathbb{E}[U\mid h, T_j]-\mathbb{E}[U\mid h] - \lambda \mathbb{E}[c_j] - \mu \mathbb{E}[\tau_j].
    $$
  - Budgeted combinatorial selection for a DAG $G$:
    $$
    \max_{G} \ \mathbb{E}[U\mid G] \ \ \text{s.t.}\ \ C(G)\le B,\ T_{\text{CP}}(G)\le D.
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Planner-executor loop with speculative parallel calls and early stopping via entropy thresholds on the LLM decoder.
  - Caching and memoization keyed by normalized arguments to amortize repeated calls.

- Importance and role
  - Meets latency/quality targets while controlling cost, enabling scalable operation under load.

### B) Latency, Throughput, and Scheduling

- Definition
  Policies and mechanisms to ensure SLO-conformant response times and system stability.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Critical-path latency:
    $$
    T_{\text{e2e}} = \max_{\text{paths } p} \sum_{v\in p} \tau(v)
    $$
  - Queueing stability ($M/G/k$ approximation):
    $$
    \rho = \frac{\lambda \mathbb{E}[\tau]}{k} < 1,\ \ \text{P95} \approx \text{Kingman bound}.
    $$
  - Deadline scheduling objective:
    $$
    \min \sum_i w_i \max(0, T^{(i)}-D_i).
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Parallel fan-out with concurrency limits; admission control based on current load; circuit breakers per tool.
  - SLA-aware routing and degraded modes (skip non-critical tools when nearing deadline).

- Importance and role
  - Predictable real-time behavior and graceful degradation in production.

### C) Reliability, Safety, and Security

- Definition
  Methods ensuring correctness, containment, and compliance.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Bayesian success model per tool:
    $$
    \theta_j \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha,\beta),\ \ \hat{p}_j=\mathbb{E}[\theta_j]
    $$
    used for Thompson sampling in tool choice.
  - Risk-penalized utility:
    $$
    U' = U - \kappa \cdot \text{RiskScore}(h, \{o_t\}).
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Sandboxing, network egress controls, data minimization, and DLP scans.
  - Prompt-injection mitigation: content sanitization, query isolation, and provenance-based trust scoring.
  - Human-in-the-loop checkpoints for high-risk actions.

- Importance and role
  - Prevents data exfiltration, misuse, and unsafe actuation; supports audits and certifications.

### D) Evaluation and Monitoring

- Definition
  Offline/online measurements to quantify utility, grounding, latency, and robustness.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Composite score:
    $$
    \text{Score} = w_Q Q + w_G G + w_L (1-\text{P95Latency}/D) + w_C (1-\text{Cost}/B)
    $$
  - Counterfactual evaluation of tool ablations:
    $$
    \Delta U_j = \mathbb{E}[U\mid \text{with } T_j] - \mathbb{E}[U\mid \text{without } T_j].
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Golden sets with freshness-sensitive labels; log-replay for safety testing; canary releases and A/B tests with guardrails.
  - LLM-as-judge with rubrics, calibrated using human labels to correct bias.

- Importance and role
  - Ensures progress, avoids regressions, and aligns with SLOs and cost targets.

---

## End-to-End Execution Pattern (Generic)

- Definition
  A standardized control flow for tool-augmented inference under real-time constraints.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Termination when confidence exceeds threshold:
    $$
    H(p_\theta(\cdot \mid h_t)) \le \epsilon \ \Rightarrow \ \text{emit}
    $$
  - Multi-armed bandit for next tool:
    $$
    j_t = \arg\max_j \ \hat{\text{VoI}}_j + \text{UCB}_j(t).
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  1) Parse request → detect required capabilities (NLP, vision, computation).
  2) Retrieve context (file search) → assess gaps → consider web search.
  3) Plan DAG of function calls/MCP tools; schedule with concurrency and deadlines.
  4) Execute with retries and fallbacks; integrate results; optional code interpreter for analytics.
  5) For multimodal outputs, invoke image generation/editing; for actuation, use computer-use agent.
  6) Verify, cite, redact, and finalize with confidence and provenance.
  7) Log metrics and traces for evaluation.

- Importance and role
  - Repeatable, auditable, and optimizable path from user intent to grounded, timely action across modalities.

## Minimal Mathematical Summary of Each Tool as an Operator

- Function calling: $T_{\text{func}}: \mathbf{a}\mapsto y$, low variance, typed, $c,\tau$ small to moderate.
- Web search: $T_{\text{web}}: q\mapsto \{(d_i,s_i)\}$, high entropy reduction but variable $\tau$, freshness gain.
- MCP servers: $T_{\text{mcp}}^{(j)}: x\mapsto y$, dynamic extension of $\mathcal{T}$ with SLOs.
- File search: $T_{\text{file}}: q\mapsto S_k$, fast, governed by index quality and governance constraints.
- Image generation: $T_{\text{img}}: (t,\text{cond})\mapsto \mathbf{x}$, diffusion sampling cost dominates, multimodal utility.
- Code interpreter: $T_{\text{code}}: (z,x)\mapsto y$, exact computation with sandboxed resources.
- Computer use: $T_{\text{gui}}: o_t\mapsto a_t$, sequential high-latency control with hierarchical policies.

These operators, composed under a budgeted, latency-aware controller, extend model capabilities, enable dynamic data integration, support complex reasoning workflows, and deliver practical, grounded performance in real-time multimodal, computational, and interactive tasks.
