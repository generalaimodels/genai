# Function Calling (Tool-Augmented Generation): Theory, Design, and Practice

## 1. Function Calling

- Definition
  - Function calling (tool calling) is the controlled delegation of sub-tasks from a generative model to external programs or services with typed interfaces, enabling access to capabilities and data beyond the model’s parametric memory.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Tool-augmented generation as a POMDP:
    $$
    \mathcal{M}=(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},T,R,\Omega,O), \quad b_t \in \Delta(\mathcal{S})
    $$
    Actions include natural-language emission and tool invocations $a_t \in \{\text{emit}(w),\, \text{call}(i,\xi)\}$ where $i$ indexes a tool and $\xi$ are arguments. Observations include tool outputs $o_{t+1}\sim O(o\mid s_{t+1}, a_t)$. Policy:
    $$
    \pi_\psi(a_t \mid h_t),\ \ h_t=(x_{1:t}, a_{1:t-1}, o_{1:t-1})
    $$
    Utility with cost-aware tool usage:
    $$
    \max_\psi \ \mathbb{E}\Big[\sum_{t} R(s_t,a_t) - \sum_{a_t = \text{call}(i,\cdot)} c_i\Big]
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - The model maintains a latent belief over task state, decides whether to invoke a tool, receives observations (outputs), updates belief, and synthesizes the final answer with provenance.

- Importance and role within AI systems
  - Enables reliable access to real-time, private, or specialized capabilities; reduces hallucinations; adds actuation; and improves sample efficiency by outsourcing computation and I/O to external systems.


## 2. Tools (Functions) and Signatures

- Definition
  - A tool is a typed callable $(t_i: \mathcal{X}_i \to \mathcal{Y}_i)$ with schema, side-effect semantics, latency, and reliability.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Signature and cost:
    $$
    t_i: \xi \in \mathcal{X}_i \mapsto y \in \mathcal{Y}_i,\quad c_i=\mathbb{E}[\text{latency}_i]+\lambda\,\text{risk}_i
    $$
  - Type map (schema) $\sigma_i: \mathcal{X}_i \to \mathcal{T}$ and validator $V_i(\xi)\in\{0,1\}$.

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Each tool has a contract (name, arguments, return type), side-effect classification (pure/impure), SLAs, quotas, and access control. Tool registries map names to dispatchers and validators.

- Importance and role
  - Clear contracts enable constrained decoding, static validation, safe execution, and composability into larger plans.


## 3. Tool Call (Action) and Gating

- Definition
  - A tool call is a decision to select a tool $i$ with arguments $\xi$ during generation, accompanied by a unique identifier for correlation.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Tool selection and arguments:
    $$
    p(i \mid h_t)=\mathrm{softmax}(W z_t),\quad \xi = \arg\max_{\xi} p_\psi(\xi \mid h_t, i)
    $$
  - Call/not-call decision by expected value of information (EVI):
    $$
    \Delta U(h_t,i)=\mathbb{E}[U \mid \text{call}(i)]-\mathbb{E}[U \mid \text{no-call}] - c_i
    $$
    Invoke when $\Delta U(h_t,i)>\tau$.

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - The policy balances utility gains (accuracy, completeness) against costs (latency, API fees, risk). Arguments are produced via constrained decoding against the tool schema.

- Importance and role
  - Prevents gratuitous calls, prioritizes high-utility tools, and stabilizes end-to-end latency and cost.


## 4. Tool Outputs (Observations) and State Update

- Definition
  - Tool outputs are observations returned by the environment, which may be structured or free text, used to update the model’s beliefs.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Belief update (Bayesian filtering):
    $$
    b_{t+1}(s') \propto O(o_{t+1}\mid s',a_t)\sum_{s} T(s'\mid s,a_t)\, b_t(s)
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - The orchestrator attaches outputs to the conversation state, normalizes into canonical formats, and optionally verifies or post-processes before re-injection.

- Importance and role
  - Converts external signals into usable evidence; underpins correctness and provenance.


## 5. End-to-End Tool Calling Flow

- Definition
  - The canonical interaction loop between model and tools from request to final answer.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Algorithm (high-level):
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    &h_0 \leftarrow \text{init(query, tool\_specs)}\\
    &\text{repeat}\\
    &\quad a_t \sim \pi_\psi(\cdot \mid h_t)\\
    &\quad \text{if } a_t=\text{call}(i,\xi):\ \text{execute }o_{t+1}=t_i(\xi)\\
    &\quad h_{t+1} \leftarrow \mathrm{Update}(h_t, a_t, o_{t+1})\\
    &\text{until } a_t=\text{stop}\\
    &\text{return final emission}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Steps: advertise tools → gated selection → argument generation → dispatch → observation normalization → re-conditioning → optional further calls → final synthesis.

- Importance and role
  - Provides a modular, auditable pathway from request to grounded output.


## 6. Schemas and Strict Mode (Constrained Decoding)

- Definition
  - A schema defines admissible argument structures and values. Strict mode enforces conformance at decode time via grammar- or automaton-constrained sampling.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Masked decoding:
    $$
    p'(w_t \mid h_t)=\frac{p(w_t\mid h_t)\,\mathbb{I}[w_t \in \mathcal{A}_t]}{\sum_{u \in \mathcal{A}_t} p(u \mid h_t)}
    $$
    where $\mathcal{A}_t$ is the next-token set allowed by the compiled grammar (e.g., from JSON Schema/EBNF/CNF).
  - Validator:
    $$
    V(\xi)=1 \iff \xi \in L(G_\text{schema})
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Compile schema to a deterministic recognizer (FSA/LL(1)/GLR). During decoding, the parser state constrains token admissibility, guaranteeing well-formed JSON/typed values and preventing spurious fields.

- Importance and role
  - Eliminates malformed arguments, increases dispatch success, and reduces downstream error handling.


## 7. Streaming and Incremental Arguments

- Definition
  - Streaming exposes partial tool calls and argument deltas as they are generated, enabling early execution or progressive UX.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Argument assembly:
    $$
    \xi = \mathrm{Assemble}(\Delta_1,\Delta_2,\dots,\Delta_m),\quad \Delta_k \in \Sigma^*
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Emit events for call-start, argument-delta, and call-complete. Maintain a per-call buffer keyed by call_id; incremental parsing validates partial JSON/grammar prefixes.

- Importance and role
  - Reduces perceived latency, supports parallel I/O (pre-fetching), and enables speculative execution.


## 8. Tool Choice Policies (Gating and Utility)

- Definition
  - A policy decides which tools are admissible and whether to invoke any at a given step.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Classification-based gating:
    $$
    p(\text{call}\mid h)=\sigma(w^\top z_h),\quad p(i\mid \text{call},h)=\mathrm{softmax}(U z_h)
    $$
  - Utility- and budget-aware decision:
    $$
    \max_{\pi}\ \mathbb{E}[U] \ \ \text{s.t.}\ \ \mathbb{E}\big[\sum_t c_{a_t}\big] \le B
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Heuristics (whitelists, domain routers), supervised gating (labels for “should call”), RL with sparse end-task rewards, and bandit-style exploration to learn cost-effective usage.

- Importance and role
  - Aligns tool usage with business constraints, SLAs, and safety policies.


## 9. Parallel Calls and Scheduling

- Definition
  - Multiple tool calls are issued concurrently when independent, subject to resource, rate, and dependency constraints.

- Mathematical formulation
  - DAG scheduling:
    $$
    G=(V,E),\ V=\{\text{calls}\},\ (u\to v)\in E \Rightarrow v \text{ depends on } u
    $$
    Minimize weighted completion time:
    $$
    \min \sum_{v\in V} w_v C_v \quad \text{s.t.}\ C_v \ge C_u + \ell_v \ \forall (u\to v),\ \text{parallelism} \le P
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Orchestrator constructs a dependency DAG from call arguments, deduplicates identical calls, enforces idempotency, and applies retry logic; results are merged by call_id.

- Importance and role
  - Achieves low latency without compromising determinism or safety.


## 10. Result Normalization and Post-Processing

- Definition
  - Standardization, validation, and fusion of tool outputs before re-conditioning the model.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Schema alignment:
    $$
    y'=\Phi(y) \ \text{where}\ \Phi:\mathcal{Y}\to\hat{\mathcal{Y}} \ \text{is canonicalizer}
    $$
  - Evidence verification (entailment score):
    $$
    s_{\text{ent}}=\mathrm{NLI}(x; y) \in [0,1]
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Normalize units and formats; deduplicate; compute uncertainty; optionally cache with TTL and provenance for future reuse.

- Importance and role
  - Enables robust downstream reasoning, caching, and faithful attribution.


## 11. Custom Tools (Free-Form I/O)

- Definition
  - Tools accepting/returning arbitrary strings, optionally constrained by user-specified grammars.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Unconstrained I/O channel:
    $$
    t(\cdot): \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Useful for code execution, data transformation, or protocols not easily expressed as fixed JSON. Combine with lightweight contracts (delimiters) or grammars to retain structure.

- Importance and role
  - Maximizes flexibility while allowing progressive hardening as schemas mature.


## 12. Grammars for Constrained Inputs (CFG/Regex)

- Definition
  - A grammar defines the language of valid inputs; decoding is constrained so arguments belong to $L(G)$.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Let $G$ be a CFG with language $L(G)$. Constrained decoding enforces:
    $$
    \forall t,\ x_{1:t} \in \mathrm{Pref}(L(G)), \quad \mathrm{Pref}(L(G))=\{p:\exists s\in L(G),\ p \text{ prefix of } s\}
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Compile JSON Schema/EBNF/Regex to a recognizer. Maintain parser state during generation and mask inadmissible tokens. Keep grammars simple and bounded to avoid search blow-ups and OOD drift.

- Importance and role
  - Guarantees syntactic validity, reduces parsing errors, and improves tool accuracy and safety.


## 13. Safety, Security, and Governance

- Definition
  - Policies and mechanisms that ensure tool calls respect permissions, minimize harm, and provide auditability.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Risk-aware utility:
$$
U' = U - \lambda_1 \cdot \mathrm{Risk}_{\text{side-effect}}
      - \lambda_2 \cdot \mathrm{PII\ exposure}
$$


- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Sandboxing, allow/deny lists, rate limiting, consent flows, redaction, idempotency keys, human-in-the-loop approvals for sensitive actions, and full call logs with provenance.

- Importance and role
  - Enables deployment in regulated domains and high-stakes applications.


## 14. Evaluation and Metrics

- Definition
  - Quantitative assessment of the correctness, robustness, and efficiency of function calling.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Call accuracy:
    $$
    \mathrm{Acc}_{\text{call}}=\frac{\#\text{correct call decisions}}{\#\text{instances}}
    $$
  - Argument exact match and F1 on structured fields; calibration (ECE) for call probabilities; end-task metrics (EM/F1/ROUGE/BLEU); latency and cost distributions; success@k when multiple tools are tried.

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Use datasets with tool annotations; measure per-tool confusion matrices; ablate gating thresholds; stress test with adversarial/long-tail inputs.

- Importance and role
  - Anchors iterative improvements and informs cost/safety trade-offs.


## 15. Training and Optimization

- Definition
  - Techniques to improve tool selection and argument fidelity via supervised learning and reinforcement learning.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Supervised objective for tool routing and arguments:
    $$
    \mathcal{L} = -\log p(i^*\mid h) - \sum_j \log p(\xi_j^* \mid h,i^*,\xi_{<j})
    $$
  - RL with end-task reward and cost:
    $$
    \max_\psi \ \mathbb{E}\Big[\sum_t r_t - c_{a_t}\Big],\ \ \nabla_\psi \approx \sum_t \nabla_\psi \log \pi_\psi(a_t\mid h_t)\,\hat{A}_t
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Distill from high-precision teachers (e.g., deterministic planners), mine hard negatives for argument fields, and calibrate call probabilities. Incorporate constrained decoding during training to close train–inference gap.

- Importance and role
  - Improves reliability, reduces over-calling, and stabilizes schema adherence.


## 16. Observability and Caching

- Definition
  - Telemetry, tracing, and reuse of tool outputs to reduce latency and cost.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Semantic cache key:
    $$
    k = \arg\max_{k'} s(q,k'),\ \ \text{reuse if } s(q,k)>\tau
    $$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Log tool name, args, outputs, latency, errors, provenance. Cache stable results with TTL; reuse cross-encoder ranks and normalized outputs; surface dashboards for drift and failure modes.

- Importance and role
  - Operational robustness, cost control, and faster iteration loops.


## 17. Orchestration Pattern (Generic Pseudocode)

- Definition
  - A minimal, platform-agnostic loop for function calling with schemas, validation, and streaming.

- Mathematical formulation
  - Notation shorthand for Sections 5–7; correctness relies on $V(\xi)=1$ and masked decoding.

- Detailed conceptual explanation (pseudocode)
  - Tool registry with schema, validator, dispatcher
  - Constrained decoder bound to active schema when generating arguments
  - Event loop with call_id correlation

- Importance and role
  - Establishes a reusable, testable backbone for research and production.

```python
class Tool:
    def __init__(self, name, schema, fn, cost=0.0):
        self.name, self.schema, self.fn, self.cost = name, schema, fn, cost
    def validate(self, args): return validate_against_schema(args, self.schema)
    def __call__(self, args): return self.fn(**args)

class Orchestrator:
    def __init__(self, model, tools):
        self.model, self.tools = model, {t.name: t for t in tools}

    def step(self, history, allowed_tools=None):
        policy = self.model.plan(history, tools=self.tools if allowed_tools is None else {
            k:self.tools[k] for k in allowed_tools})
        if policy.action == "emit":
            return {"type": "emit", "text": policy.text}
        if policy.action == "call":
            tool = self.tools[policy.tool]
            args = constrained_decode(self.model, history, grammar=compile_schema(tool.schema))
            assert tool.validate(args)
            out = tool(args)
            return {"type": "observation", "tool": tool.name, "args": args, "output": out}

    def run(self, query, budget=None):
        history = [{"role":"user","content":query}]
        spent = 0.0
        while True:
            event = self.step(history)
            if event["type"] == "emit":
                return event["text"]
            else:
                spent += self.tools[event["tool"]].cost
                if budget is not None and spent > budget: break
                history.append({"role":"tool","name":event["tool"],
                                "args":event["args"],"content":event["output"]})
        return self.model.summarize(history)
```
