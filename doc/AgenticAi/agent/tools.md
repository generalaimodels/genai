Formal model of tool-augmented LLMs for real-time systems
- Definition
  - A tool-augmented LLM is an agent that interleaves language generation with external actions (tool invocations) to optimize task performance subject to latency, cost, and reliability constraints in partially observed environments.
- Mathematical formulation
  - Let tools be $T=\{\tau_k\}_{k=1}^K$, each with callable interface $\tau_k: \mathcal{A}_k \to \mathcal{O}_k$, stochastic latency $\ell_k \sim \mathcal{L}_k$, cost $c_k$, and reliability $r_k \in [0,1]$.
  - The agent operates in a POMDP $(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{O},\mathcal{A},P,R,\gamma)$ with history $h_t=(o_{\le t},a_{<t})$. Actions are $a_t \in \{\text{Generate}, \text{Call}(\tau_k,\alpha)\}$.
  - Utility with constraints:
    $$
    \max_\pi \;\mathbb{E}\!\left[ R(y,y^*) \right]\quad
    \text{s.t.}\;\;\mathbb{E}\!\left[\sum_t \ell_{a_t}\right]\le B,\;\; \mathbb{E}\!\left[\sum_t c_{a_t}\right]\le C
    $$
    Lagrangian relaxation:
    $$
    \max_\pi \;\mathbb{E}\!\left[ R(y,y^*) - \lambda \sum_t \ell_{a_t}- \mu \sum_t c_{a_t}\right]
    $$
  - Value of information (VOI) for tool $\tau_k$ at history $h_t$:
    $$
    \mathrm{VOI}_k(h_t)=\mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_{\tau_k}(\cdot \mid h_t)}\!\left[\mathbb{E}[R \mid h_t,z]\right]-\mathbb{E}[R\mid h_t]
    $$
    Call when $\mathrm{VOI}_k(h_t) > \lambda \mathbb{E}[\ell_k]+\mu c_k$.
- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - The LLM is a planner that selects tool calls to acquire information, compute, or act in the environment. Observations from tools are appended to context and update the belief over hidden task states, improving downstream reasoning.
- Importance and role
  - Enables dynamic knowledge access, delegation of computation, multimodal I/O, and interactive control necessary for real-world tasks under real-time constraints.

Decision-theoretic tool selection and scheduling
- Definition
  - Selection: choose which tool to call and with what arguments; scheduling: sequence/parallelize calls to meet latency/cost budgets while maximizing task performance.
- Mathematical formulation
  - Contextual selection using utility scores:
    $$
    u_k(h_t)=\Delta \widehat{\mathbb{E}}[R \mid h_t,\tau_k] - \lambda \widehat{\mathbb{E}}[\ell_k] - \mu c_k
    ,\quad \pi(k\mid h_t)=\mathrm{softmax}(u_k(h_t))
    $$
  - Parallel scheduling with dependency DAG $G=(V,E)$ and per-call SLO $b_v$:
    $$
    \min_{\text{schedule}} \;\; \mathbb{E}\!\left[\max_{v\in V} \mathrm{finish}(v)\right]\;\; \text{s.t.}\;\; \mathrm{finish}(v)\le b_v,\;\; \text{res. constraints}
    $$
  - Latency-constrained policy via Lagrangian actor-critic:
    $$
    \nabla_\theta J(\theta)=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\sum_t \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t\mid h_t)\left(R_t-\lambda \ell_{a_t}-\mu c_{a_t}-b(h_t)\right)\right]
    $$
- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Tool calls can be batched or executed concurrently when independent; adaptive gating suppresses calls when expected marginal utility is low. Belief-aware VOI estimates and amortized critics guide efficient decisions.
- Importance and role
  - Achieves accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs required in production systems with strict P95/P99 constraints.

Function calling
- Definition
  - A structured invocation mechanism where the model outputs a schema-conformant call to a named function with typed arguments, receiving machine-readable results for further reasoning.
- Mathematical formulation
  - Interface: $\tau: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{O}$ with JSON schema $S(\mathcal{A})$. Argument extraction is a conditional distribution $p_\theta(\alpha \in \mathcal{A}\mid h)$ constrained by $S$:
    $$
    p_\theta(\alpha\mid h) \propto p_\theta(\alpha\mid h)\cdot \mathbf{1}\{\alpha \models S\}
    $$
  - End-to-end expected gain:
    $$
    \Delta(h)=\mathbb{E}\!\left[R\mid h,\tau(\alpha)\right]-\mathbb{E}[R\mid h]-\lambda \mathbb{E}[\ell_\tau]-\mu c_\tau
    $$
- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Steps:
    1) Tool selection and argument plan in natural language.
    2) Constrained decoding to a JSON call.
    3) Execution and observation capture.
    4) Reflection: verify, possibly re-call or fallback.
  - Deterministic semantics and type safety reduce hallucinated actions; argument verification and retry loops handle schema violations.
- Importance and role
  - Primary mechanism to integrate deterministic computations, databases, and microservices; enables modularity, observability, and compliance.

Web search
- Definition
  - Retrieval of up-to-date web documents and aggregation to ground generation in current, external information.

    $$
    s(d,q)=\alpha\,\mathrm{BM25}(d,q)+ (1-\alpha)\,\cos\!\left(e(d),e(q)\right)
    $$
  - RAG objective:
    $$
    p(y\mid x)=\sum_{z\in \mathcal{Z}} p(y\mid x,z)\,p(z\mid x), \quad z = \text{retrieved snippets}
    $$
  - Multi-hop retrieval via iterative policy:
    $$
    q_{t+1}=\pi_Q(q_t, z_t, h), \;\; z_t \sim \mathrm{TopK}(q_t)
    $$
  - Faithfulness scoring for citation alignment:
    $$
    \mathrm{Align}(y,z)=\frac{1}{|y|}\sum_{i}\max_{j}\cos\!\left(e(y_i),e(z_j)\right)
    $$
- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Pipelines combine query decomposition, snippet selection, de-duplication, and evidence-conditioned generation. Verifiability enforced with citation pointers and entailment checks.
- Importance and role
  - Mitigates model staleness and hallucinations; essential for real-time, dynamic knowledge tasks (news, pricing, APIs).

Remote MCP servers
- Definition
  - Capability injection via Model Context Protocol servers that advertise tools, resources, and prompts over a standardized, typed transport.
- Mathematical formulation
  - Server advertises capability set $\mathcal{C}=\{\tau_k\}$ with metadata $\psi_k=(S_k, c_k, \mathcal{L}_k, r_k)$. The planner’s action space augments to $\mathcal{A}\cup\{\text{Call}(\tau_k,\alpha): \tau_k\in \mathcal{C}\}$.
  - Reliability-aware utility with availability $a_k$:
    $$
    u_k(h)=a_k\,\Delta \widehat{\mathbb{E}}[R \mid h,\tau_k]-(\lambda \widehat{\mathbb{E}}[\ell_k]+\mu c_k)
    $$
- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Handshake: discover, authenticate, and cache schemas; sandbox calls with quotas; apply typed argument validation and output parsing. Cross-server redundancy can reduce tail latencies via hedged requests.
- Importance and role
  - Safely extends the agent with third-party skills (databases, proprietary models, simulators) without retraining; enables scalable, federated tool ecosystems.

File search
- Definition
  - Retrieval over a local or remote corpus of user-provided files using symbolic and vector indices.
- Mathematical formulation
  - Chunking $C=\{c_i\}$, embeddings $v_i=e(c_i)$, ANN index $\mathcal{I}$. Query embedding $v_q=e(q)$, score $s_i=\cos(v_q,v_i)$; hybrid score with BM25 as above.
  - Marginal contribution of $m$ chunks:
    $$
    \mathrm{MC}(m)=\mathbb{E}[R\mid h, z_{1:m}]-\mathbb{E}[R\mid h, z_{1:m-1}]
    $$
  - Optimal $m^*$
 with latency-cost penalty:
   $$m^* = \arg\max_m \left(
  \sum_{j=1}^{m} \mathrm{MC}(j)
  - \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{m} \ell_j
  - \mu \sum_{j=1}^{m} c_j\right)$$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Ingestion (parsing, OCR), normalization, chunking with overlap, embedding, indexing (HNSW/IVF), retrieval, re-ranking, and grounded synthesis. Freshness managed by incremental updates and invalidation.
- Importance and role

  - Denoising diffusion (DDPM/SDE) with forward noising $q(x_t\mid x_{t-1})=\mathcal{N}\!(\sqrt{1-\beta_t}\,x_{t-1},\beta_t I)$ and reverse model $\epsilon_\theta$:
    $$
    p_\theta(x_{t-1}\mid x_t, c)=\mathcal{N}\!\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta_t}}\left(x_t - \beta_t \epsilon_\theta(x_t,t,c)\right),\sigma_t^2 I\right)
    $$
  - Classifier-free guidance:
    $$
    \hat{\epsilon}_\theta = (1+w)\,\epsilon_\theta(x_t,t,c) - w\,\epsilon_\theta(x_t,t,\varnothing)
    $$
  - Inpainting with mask $m$:
    $$
    x_0 \leftarrow m\odot x^{\text{cond}}_0 + (1-m)\odot x^{\text{gen}}_0
    $$
- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - Conditioning via cross-attention on text tokens; controllability via guidance, ControlNets, LoRA adapters; fast sampling using DPM-Solver or distilled samplers; safety via content filters.
- Importance and role
  - Enables multimodal assistants, UI prototyping, visual grounding, and on-the-fly diagram generation within interactive workflows.

Code interpreter
- Definition
  - Secure execution environment where the model writes and runs code to perform computation, analysis, and verification.
- Mathematical formulation

   $$
\mathrm{Verify} = \mathbf{1}\{T(o)=\text{true}\}, 
\quad 
\text{Self-consistency: } 
y^* = \arg\max_y \sum_{b=1}^B \mathbf{1}\{f(o_b)=y\}
$$

  - Expected improvement for compute-heavy subproblem $g$ with complexity $C(n)$:
  $$\Delta \approx \mathbb{E}[R \mid \text{exec}(g)]
 - \mathbb{E}[R]
 - \lambda \kappa C(n)
 - \mu c_{\text{exec}}$$

- Detailed conceptual explanation
  - The LLM plans algorithms, writes code, executes in a sandbox with resource limits, reads results, and iterates. Property-based tests and assertions reduce silent errors; numerical stability and precision settings matter.
- Importance and role
  - Offloads precise calculation, data processing, simulation, and verification beyond the LLM’s parametric limits, improving accuracy and interpretability.

    $$
  - Vision-language grounding of targets $r$:
