Generalized agentic pipeline: formal model

Definition
A configurable agentic pipeline is a controlled stochastic computation graph parameterized by a configuration θ over attributes that govern message construction, memory, retrieval, tool use, reasoning, multi-agent routing, and output constraints. Each run is a constrained optimization over policies for prompting, retrieval, tool selection, and formatting.

Mathematical formulation
- State and messages:
  - Conversation history at turn t: H_t = [m_1, …, m_{t-1}]
  - Session state: σ_t ∈ Σ
  - Knowledge base: K = (D, I), where D are documents and I are indices
  - Tools: T = {τ_i}
  - Config: θ ∈ Θ (all attributes)
  - User input: u_t
- Prompt assembly:
  $$
  P_t = \psi_{\text{sys}}(\theta, \sigma_t) \oplus \psi_{\text{context}}(\theta,\sigma_t)
        \oplus \psi_{\text{history}}(H_t,\theta) \oplus \psi_{\text{extra}}(\theta)
        \oplus \psi_{\text{user}}(u_t,\theta)
  $$
  where ⊕ denotes concatenation with role and metadata controls.
- Knowledge retrieval (with filters F(θ)):
  $$
  \mathcal{D}_t = \text{Top-}k\_{\;d\in D: F_\theta(d)}\, s\big(q_t(\theta), d; \theta\big)
  $$
  with scoring s possibly combining vector and lexical components.
- Tool policy (budget L ≤ tool_call_limit):
  $$
  \pi_{\text{tool}}^*(\cdot;\theta) = \arg\max_{\pi \in \Pi_\theta}\, \mathbb{E}[U(y_t,\sigma_{t+1}) - \lambda C(\pi)]
  $$
  subject to call budget and tool_choice constraints.
- Reasoning depth:
  $$
  k \in [k_{\min}(\theta), k_{\max}(\theta)]
  $$
- Model inference:
  $$
  y_t \sim \mathcal{M}_\theta(P_t, \mathcal{D}_t, \text{tool outputs}, k)
  $$
- Retries with exponential backoff:
  $$
  \Delta_r = \Delta_0 \cdot 2^{r-1} \quad \text{for} \quad r=1,\dots,R
  $$
- Memory/state update:
  $$
  \sigma_{t+1} = g(\sigma_t, H_t, y_t;\theta)
  $$
- Objective:
  $$
  \max_{\text{assembly},\,\pi_{\text{tool}},\,k}\;\mathbb{E}\left[ U(y_t,\sigma_{t+1}) \right]
  \;\; \text{s.t.}\;\; \text{cost} \le B_\theta, \;\text{formats}(\theta), \;\text{team routing}(\theta)
  $$

   - Call model with stream/stream_intermediate_steps; store_events excluding events_to_skip.

8) Validate and parse
   - If structured_outputs/use_json_mode or response_model/parse_response, validate; fallback to parser_model with parser_model_prompt or output_model with output_model_prompt.

9) Retry policy
   - If validation fails or success_criteria unmet, apply retries with delay_between_retries and exponential_backoff.

10) Update state and storage
    - Update memory (enable_agentic_memory/enable_user_memories).
    - Generate session summaries (enable_session_summaries); add references if configured.
    - Save artifacts (save_response_to_file) and persist via storage; update extra_data.

11) Team coordination
    - If team is configured, route via role and respond_directly; add_transfer_instructions and aggregate with team_response_separator; maintain team_session_id/team_session_state and workflow identifiers.

12) Monitoring and telemetry
    - Emit debug logs per debug_mode/debug_level; send monitoring/telemetry events.


Practical importance across AI research and applications
- Robustness: retries with backoff, parsing/validation, summaries, tool budgets, hooks, and event storage prevent failure cascades and enable recovery.
- Scalability: history/session controls, RAG filters, team decomposition, streaming, and storage backends support low-latency, high-throughput multi-tenant operation.
- Optimization: reasoning depth, tool policies, model specialization, structured decoding, and retrieval tuning maximize utility under cost/latency constraints.
- Generalization: the attribute set parameterizes a universal agent run abstraction that adapts to diverse domains (NLP, vision, speech, data agents) while preserving reproducibility and governance.
